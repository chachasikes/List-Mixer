Drag List is a sample module create for a test-writing workshop as a demo. 
The module contains some instructions on how to set it up.

I realized that the module was the wrong name for the project, and that
it would be smarter to abstract the various components of the javascript
interaction. Rather than dragging (which is not always accessible), a
user should be able to click a button which would allow different
interactions. 

Leaving this module as a working example of what listmixer is aiming for.
