Several default interactions will be made available.

These will probably include:

* 'Front Page Featured List' 
  Just a simple list of things people might want on a homepage. There are about 10,000 ways to do this in Drupal already.
  Demonstrates saving nodereferences to a list.
* 'Babble'
  Like DevSeed's 'shoutbox' module, which acts like Yammer - intranet twitter. Demonstration of text field node saving 
  functionality.  
* To-Do List
  Provides a text field for adding items to a to-do list. Provides list <li> and weight rearrangement to store reordered
  fields.
* Photo set
  Provides a simple view + image content type that demonstrates adding a checkbox to nodes and allows for subsets of
  a gallery view to be created for many users, many lists. Similar to Flickr Batch Organizer's functionality for making
  sets from collections.
